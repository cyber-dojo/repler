Initially the Docker image would not build.
ujson would not build because there was no C++ compiler.
So I've added g++ to apk --update.

At the moment the Docker image is a fairly hefty 333MB.
I am pretty sure that some Docker tricks can be pulled to
uninstall gcc g++ make since they are almost certainly
only needed for the build step. See for example
